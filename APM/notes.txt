ES2015 has two for loop methods:

for .. in
for .. of

the "for .. in" method iterates over the properties of an Object and gets the INDEX of each item
['do', 're', 'mi'] == [0, 1, 2]

the "for .. of" method iterates over iterable objects such as an array and gets each ITEM
['do', 're', 'mi'] == do, re, mi

Interpolation:
{{ pageTitle }}

Property Binding:
<img [src]="product.imageUrl">

Event Binding:
<button (click)="toggleImage()">

Interpolation with JavaScript Conditional Operator
{{showImage ? 'Hide' : 'Show'}}    (Hide is the TRUE value for showImage, and Show is the FALSE value)

Two Way Binding:
<input [(ngModel)]='listFilter'>


Piping values is useful for formatting the values:
Pipes also have some parameters you can modify such as the below:
{{ product.price | currency:'EUR':true:'1.2-2' | lowercase }}
- this pipes the price into a curreny of Locale Euro, true displays the euro symbol instead of the EUR abbreviation,
1.2-2 means:
    1 = no less than one digit to the left of the decimal point
    .2 = no less than two digits after the decimal point
    -2 = no more than two digits after the decimal point
    (€1.00, €25.99, etc)
